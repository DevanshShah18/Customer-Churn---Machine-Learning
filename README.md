This machine learning project explores customer behavior by predicting two key outcomes: churn likelihood and coupon usage response. Using classification models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, I analyzed Excel-based customer data to uncover patterns related to spending habits and loyalty card ownership. The model was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, measuring performance through accuracy, standard deviation, and ROC-AUC analysis. A cost-benefit matrix was also integrated to guide business decisions based on model predictions. The project was developed in Python using pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib libraries.
